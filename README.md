# S7_Launcher
SIMATIC Manager V 5.x Launcher

This Launcher lets your Simatic Manager projects behave like TIA, in the sense that you can open directly from the project folder 
without have to open SIMATIC Manager then browse to the project location
This will work on a Single Project, and also a Multi Project

Depending on interest this may become something bigger

Instructions for Use
====================

1. Download the S7 Launcher.exe
2. Place the S7 Launcher.exe in ANY Simatic Manager project folders
3. You can now run the S7 Launcher, and Simatic will open with the project loaded
